## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Importing the data

I have 2 sets of data I would like to compare:
The rate of households paying income tax and the poverty rate in each local authority in France. I am going to importe the 2 sets of data and combining them.

### Income tax

```{r}
read.csv("Incometax.csv", sep = ";", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

To store the data, I assign it to a variable.

```{r}
Incometax <- read.csv("Incometax.csv", sep = ";", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

### Poverty rate

I import the data.

```{r}
read.csv("Povertyrate.csv", sep = ";", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

To store the data, I assign it to a variable.

```{r}
Povertyrate <- read.csv("Povertyrate.csv", sep = ";", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

## Combining the data 

I use the function cbind which enables to create new columns in a file.

```{r}
WealthbyLA <- cbind(Incometax,Povertyrate)
```


## Exporting the data

I export the data with the function write.csv

```{r}
write.csv(WealthbyLA,"Wealthcombined.csv")
```
