## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Importing data

## First variable

I use the function read.csv in order to import data

```{r}
read.csv("Expenses_20_21.csv", sep = ";", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

In order to store the data, I assign it to a variable. I don't forget the seperator ";".

```{r}
Expenses2021 <- read.csv("Expenses_20_21.csv", sep = ";")
```

## 2nd variable

I import the data
```{r}
read.csv("Expenses_19_20.csv", sep = ";",stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

I store the data
```{r}
Expenses2020 <- read.csv("Expenses_19_20.csv", sep = ";")
```

## 3rd variable

I import the data 
```{r}
read.csv("Expenses_18_19.csv", sep = ";",stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

I store the data
```{r}
Expenses2019 <- read.csv("Expenses_18_19.csv", sep = ";")
```

## 4th variable

I import the data 
```{r}
read.csv("Expenses_17_18.csv", sep = ";",stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

I store the data
```{r}
Expenses2018 <- read.csv("Expenses_17_18.csv", sep = ";")
```

# Combining the data

I use the function do.call in order to combine several sets of data.

```{r}
ExpensesTotal <- do.call("rbind",  list(Expenses2018, Expenses2019, Expenses2020, Expenses2021))
```

# Exporting the data
